# AchiStar
Problem Statement
I'm DevOps consultant in AchiStar Technologies. 
The company decided to implement DevOps to develop and deliver their products. 
Since it is an Agile organization, it follows Scrum methodology to develop the projects incrementally.
Here i'm working with multiple DevOps Engineers to build a Docker Jenkins Pipeline. 
During the sprint planning, we agreed on this project and plan to meet requirements, system configurations, and track the efficiency.
